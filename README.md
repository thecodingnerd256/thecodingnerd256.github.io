Hi there and welcome to my repository.  I am The Coding Nerd and this is a repo
with the projects that I have created and published on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxaQYymOsoBbjQyDU7sFKQQ).  Feel free
to have a browse and if you feel up to it why don't you create your own version
of one of these fun little projects and link to it in this repo.
